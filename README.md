# Edge Device Audio Event Recognition

Welcome to our project's GitHub repository! Our work focuses on exploring the potential of audio event recognition using convolutional neural networks on edge devices, like Raspberry Pi, aiming to achieve real-time audio analysis and classification.

## Audio Files
We're excited to announce that we're sharing our experimental audio files used in this project. These files, recorded at various volume levels, were critical in assessing the performance of our model. You can find these audio files right here in the repository, ready for you to download, explore and perhaps even use in your own projects.

## Coming Soon: Code Scripts
To truly facilitate open and reproducible research, we're working on preparing the scripts used in our project. These detailed scripts will provide an in-depth look into our methodology and allow you to replicate, modify or even extend our work. Expect to see these scripts uploaded here soon!
